# Testing your Integration

Since currently the login.gov team manages service provider application configurations manually, we’ll first deploy your configuration to a test environment first.

If you wish, you can point a non-production site to our test environment. You can provide the testing config to us and we’ll set it up in our test environment.

You have options to test it out ahead of time since we’re managing the config for you; just [talk to us](contact_us) if you need anything.

When you are ready to move to production, simply [contact us](/contact_us) to move your application configurations to the login.gov production environment.
