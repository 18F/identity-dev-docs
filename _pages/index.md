#### How to deploy and manage your application 

- [Determine prerequisites](https://developers.login.gov/attributes/)
- [Build and configure your application](https://developers.login.gov/examples/)
- [Generating self-signed certificates](https://developers.login.gov/certs/)
- [Register your application](https://developers.login.gov/register/)

You can learn more about [login.gov](https://login.gov/) and how the identity management system [keeps personal information private] (https://login.gov/security/), and visit our [open-source repository] (https://github.com/18F/identity-idp).

_Note: The documentation uses standard identity provider terminology as defined in both [OIDC] (https://developers.login.gov/openid-connect/) and [SAML] (https://developers.login.gov/saml/) documentation._
