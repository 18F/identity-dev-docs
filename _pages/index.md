You can learn more about [login.gov](https://login.gov/) and how the identity management system [keeps personal information private](https://login.gov/security/), and visit our [open-source repository](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp).

_Note: The documentation uses standard identity provider terminology as defined in both [OIDC]({{site.baseurl}}/openid-connect/) and [SAML]({{site.baseurl}}/saml/) documentation._
